    <h1>About Nike</h1>
    <p>At Nike, we believe in the power of sport to move the world forward. Since 1972, we've been driven by a simple yet powerful mission: to bring inspiration and innovation to every athlete in the world — and if you have a body, you’re an athlete.
From our roots in Oregon to our global presence today, Nike has been at the forefront of performance, design, and culture. We create products that not only help athletes reach their full potential but also reflect the passion, creativity, and resilience of our communities.</p>
    <p>Innovation fuels everything we do — from cutting-edge footwear and apparel to sustainability-focused solutions that shape the future of sport. Our relentless pursuit of progress has led to breakthroughs like Nike Air, Flyknit, and React technologies, designed not only to enhance performance but to minimize environmental impact.</p>
    <p>We’re more than just a brand — we’re a global community. Nike supports athletes at every level, from emerging talent to world champions, and partners with organizations that champion inclusivity, equality, and access to sport for all. Through initiatives like Move to Zero, we're working toward a zero carbon, zero waste future to help protect the planet we all share.</p>
    <p>At Nike, diversity drives innovation. We celebrate every voice, every background, and every story. Whether you're on the track, in the streets, or chasing your next personal best, we’re here to empower you to push beyond limits and redefine what's possible.</p>
    <p>This is more than sport. This is movement. This is purpose. This is Nike.<br>
        <b>Just Do It.</b></p>
